Java server for the NetStereo application.  Clients can be found at
http://ofb.net/~jheiss/netstereo/

Configuration is done through two files:  server.properties and the
init script which starts the server.  An example of each is included
with fairly verbose comments to guide you in configuring things for
your setup.

Because of a bug/lack of feature in the JDK
(http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4045688.html and
http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4117557.html),
you must execute the server in the directory you want to be the
working directory (the directory with your MP3 files).  See the
included init script for an example.  Right now the configuration file
(server.properties) must also reside in that directory.  If you
are in UNIX, that could be a symbolic link to someplace more
convenient.

Once you've edited the init script, if you want to start the server
when your system boots up you should copy the script to /etc/init.d
(or whatever your system uses) and make links in the appropriate rcX.d
directories.  With Red Hat Linux you can make these links with
'chkconfig stereoserver.init on'.

This was developed using the Sun JDK 1.3 for Linux.  The
Java Media Framework (http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/) and
Java Communications (http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/) addons,
a well as the MP3 class from http://www.rabbitfarm.com/site/id3.html,
will be needed to compile everything, but you should be able to
run the server without them if you've configured it not to use them.
(Compiling isn't necessary unless you change something, since I've
included all of the .class files.)  A copy of the MP3 class is included,
but the Java addons need to be compiled and installed into your JDK so
I'll leave that up to you.  (The MP3 class is only used by the JMF code,
so if you disable JMF you won't need the MP3 class either.)

Note that I do the Java Communications development using the
RXTX implementation (http://www.rxtx.org/) since Sun does not have
a reference implementation for Linux.  I use the latest version
from their CVS repository.

And as a side note, the server works fine in Windows if you configure
it to use JMF as the song player.
