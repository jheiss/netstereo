Java server for the NetStereo application.  Clients can be found at
http://ofb.net/~jheiss/netstereo/

Configuration is done through one file:  server.properties.  An
example is included with fairly verbose comments to guide you in
configuring things for your setup.

Because of what I consider a bug in the JDK, you must execute the
server in the directory you want to be the working directory (the
directory with your MP3 files).  See the included init script for
an example.  Right now the configuration file (server.properties)
must also reside in that directory.

This was developed using the Sun JDK 1.3 for Linux.  The
Java Media Framework (http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/) and
Java Communications (http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/) addons,
a well as the MP3 class from http://www.vdheide.de/software/java_mp3.html,
will be needed to compile everything, but you should be able to
run the server without them if you've configured it not to use them.
A copy of the MP3 class is included, but the Java addons need to be
compiled and installed into your JDK so I'll leave that up to you.
(The MP3 class is only used by the JMF code, so if you disable JMF you
won't need the MP3 class either.)

Note that I do the Java Communications development using the
RXTX implementation (http://www.rxtx.org/) since Sun does not have
a reference implementation for Linux.  I use the latest version
from their CVS repository.

And as a side note, the server works fine in Windows if you configure
it to use JMF as the song player.
