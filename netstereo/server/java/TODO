Improve handling of serial line in println in SerialCommunicator
  - Current it does an isCTS() and then a println
  - Sometimes the state changes between those two and the println
    blocks, causing all sorts of trouble
  - perhaps notifyOnCTS() would be useful?
Improve authentication (i.e. something other than null auth)
  - More methods
  - Configuration
Improve logging
  - Have syslog class, but requires that syslogd is listening on network
    (which isn't good for security)
  - Either improve syslog class so it can write to a UNIX socket (which
    Java doesn't support) or devise another method of logging
