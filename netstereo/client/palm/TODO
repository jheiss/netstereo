Select correct playlist in list if playlists are loaded
Replace current 10 second hack for detecting device power off with
  a request to receive sysNotifyLateWakeupEvent notifications
Attempt to re-authenticate if server rejects a command for auth problems
  (useful if server has restarted)
Remove wait option on SendString, nothing uses it
Error log
  Error messages from the server are currently ignored.  We don't want
  to clutter the display with them, but it would be nice if the last
  few messages were available for the user to look at.  Perhaps a button
  or something that indicates how many have been received that the user
  can click on to bring up a log.
Preferences database and form
  Currently everything is hardcoded.  The following stuff should be
  configurable by the user:
  - Baud rate
  - Hardware flow control?
  - Trim playlist path
  - Favorite playlist
Replace labels with fields
  The O'Reilly book says it is better to use fields than labels for
  things where you are changing the text.  Something to look into
  for the artist, album, song, songinfo and time labels.
