Palm client for the NetStereo application.  The server and other types
of clients can be found at http://ofb.net/~jheiss/netstereo/

This was developed using the prc-tools version 2.0 and the version 3.5
Palm SDK.  I know it won't compile without modification using an
earlier SDK, don't know about earlier versions of the prc-tools.

Testing is done on my PalmPilot Professional (PalmOS 2.0).  Devices
running PalmOS 1.0 will not work.  Anything later should, but hasn't
been tested.
