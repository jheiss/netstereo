Java clients for the NetStereo application (currently only a GUI client
using the Swing toolkit is implemented).  The server and other types
of clients can be found at http://ofb.net/~jheiss/netstereo/

This was developed using the v1.3 JDK from Sun on Red Hat Linux 7.0
and Windows 2000.  It should compile using any JDK which supports Swing.

Testing is mainly done on Red Hat Linux 7.0, but I occasionally check
to make sure it runs under Windows as well (using the Sun JDK for
Windows).
