Java clients for the NetStereo application (currently only a GUI client
using the Swing toolkit is implemented).  The server and other types
of clients can be found at http://ofb.net/~jheiss/netstereo/

Configuration (server, port, etc.) is hardcoded in StereoClient.java.
You'll have to edit that and recompile for now.  The Swing client is
SwingClient.class, so 'java SwingClient' should get things fired up.

This was developed using the v1.3 JDK from Sun on Red Hat Linux 7.0
and Windows 2000.  It should compile using any JDK which supports Swing.

Testing is mainly done on Red Hat Linux 7.0, but I occasionally check
to make sure it runs under Windows as well (using the Sun JDK for
Windows).
